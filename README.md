Hi, Iâ€™m @zcohensrhs or Zachary Cohen

I'm a technology and engineering education teacher in the greater Annapolis area in Maryland. I teach 9th-12th grade, focusing in aerospace engineering and graphic design classes. I also run the 3D printing for our school and run two personal 3D printers as well.
